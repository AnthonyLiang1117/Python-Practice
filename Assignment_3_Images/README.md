# Assignment 3: Images

In this assignment we are going to be writing image algorithms! Woot.

Two side by side images of Stanford's Main Quad. The left image is a normal photo and the right image is tinted pinkish purple.

Two side by side images of smoke plumes from above; the left image is normal and the right image is black and white except for certain parts which are highlighted in red.

Six image tiles of Simba, Chris's dog, filtered with 6 different effects to look like an Andy Warhol piece.

We are going to use a library we put together for you called SimpleImage. You can read all about it in this handout:
