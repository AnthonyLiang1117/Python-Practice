# Get list

Write a program in get_list.py which continuously asks the user to enter values which are added one by one into a list. When the user presses enter without typing anything, print the list.

Here's a sample run (user input in bold italics):

$ python get_list.py
Enter a value: 1
Enter a value: 2
Enter a value: 3
Enter a value:
Here's the list:
['1', '2', '3']
